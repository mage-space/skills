  Edit an existing video with a prompt using Mage: describe the change and it
  is applied across the clip while the motion, camera, timing, and composition
  stay, with optional reference images or characters for a specific subject,
  object, or look. The Video Editor app as a skill, on Lemon by default.
  Use when: "edit this video", "change her jacket to red in this clip", "make
  this video look like anime", "replace the background of this clip", "turn
  day into night in this video", "add snow to this footage", "restyle this
  clip", "put this product in the video". NOT for: swapping a face or a whole
  person in a video (mage-video-face-swap, mage-video-character-swap), making
  a video from nothing or from a still (mage-generate), lip sync
  (mage-lipsync), or cutting, trimming, and timeline work.

compatibility: Requires the Mage connector (https://mcp.mage.space/mcp) and a Mage account with Gems.

# Mage Video Editor

Change what a video shows without re-shooting it: one instruction, applied across the whole clip, with the original motion and framing kept. This is the [Video Editor app](https://www.mage.space/apps/video-editor) as a skill: the same models, prompts, and defaults, run through the Mage connector.

## Before you start

1. **Mage tools:** `get_model`, `estimate_cost`, `generate`, `get_request`, `list_characters`, and `create_upload` for local files. If they are missing, ask the user to connect Mage (Claude: Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector, `https://mcp.mage.space/mcp`; Claude Code: `claude mcp add --transport http mage https://mcp.mage.space/mcp`; others: https://www.mage.space/mcp), then wait.
2. **Inputs are links:** https URLs of the files themselves, data URLs under about 3 MB, uploads from disk (`create_upload`, when you can run commands), or earlier Mage results. Files attached to the chat never reach Mage: ask for a direct link. A page that plays a video (YouTube, Instagram, a Drive preview) is not a file.
3. **The clip's length matters.** Each model accepts a range of clip lengths and Lemon bills the clip's seconds. Measure it when you can run commands (`ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of csv=p=0 clip.mp4`); otherwise ask the user how long it is. `estimate_cost` measures a clip that is a `create_upload` URL or an earlier Mage result, and answers `requires_media_measurement` for a clip on another host: upload it with `create_upload` to price it.
4. **Rights.** The user needs permission for the footage and for anyone recognizable in it.

## UX rules

1. Don't ask for what the request already gives. Ask for everything that is missing in one compact question, then wait.
2. Send the app's prompt below word for word. Fill in only the marked slots; don't rewrite, translate, or add to it.
3. Always quote the model and the price in Gems and wait for a yes before generating.
4. The user's instruction is the prompt. Don't expand or restyle it; on Cherry models it goes inside the app's wrapper, unchanged.
5. Deliver the link with a one-line label (model, size or length, Gems spent). No prompts, ids, or JSON. Reply in the user's language. Links last 30 days.

## Inputs

1. **The video:** one clip, MP4, MOV, or WebM. 1–15 seconds on the default model; other models differ (`references/models.md`).
2. **The change,** in the user's words: their instruction as a sentence of its own, without the link or the request around it ("In this clip <link>, change her jacket to red" is sent as "Change her jacket to red."). Don't add to it. If it is vague ("make it better"), ask what should change.
3. **References (optional, up to 2):** images of a specific subject, object, or look the change involves, or saved characters by `@handle`. Mention each `@handle` in the instruction where it belongs ("replace the dog with @rex"), and call a reference image "the reference image" ("make her wear the jacket from the reference image").

## Settings

The app's defaults:

- Model: Lemon (`lemon`, `model_id: "lemon"`).
- `resolution`: `480p`, the cheapest. Offer `720p` or `1080p` with the price when the user wants a final.
- `duration`: the clip's length rounded to the nearest whole second (Lemon takes any whole second from `"2"` to `"30"`).
- `aspect_ratio`: the option closest to the clip's shape (`16:9`, `4:3`, `1:1`, `3:4`, `9:16`).
- `use_character_voices: false`.

Other models the app offers (Cherry line, Plum, Plum Max, Berry, Grok Video), their clip limits, their fields, and the wrapped prompt Cherry needs: `references/models.md`. Read it before using any model but Lemon.

## Run

On Lemon the prompt is the user's instruction alone:

```json
{
  "model_id": "lemon",
  "resolution": "480p",
  "duration": "<covers the clip>",
  "aspect_ratio": "<closest to the clip>",
  "videos": [
    "<the clip>"
  ],
  "image": "<optional first reference>",
  "additional_images": [
    "<optional second reference>"
  ],
  "use_character_voices": false,
  "prompt": "<the user's instruction>"
}
```

Leave `image` and `additional_images` out when there are no reference images.

1. `get_model` for the architecture, once per conversation, to confirm its fields, options, and rules.
2. `estimate_cost` with the exact config. Tell the user the model, resolution, length, and price in Gems, and **wait for a yes**. Video is expensive and the price climbs with resolution and length.
3. `generate` with a new UUID as `idempotency_key`, then `get_request` with `wait_seconds: 120`, repeated quietly until the status is `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. Video takes minutes.

`duration` and `resolution` are strings, written exactly as `get_model` lists them (`"4"`, `"480p"`, and on Plum `"768P"`).

## Check and deliver

Deliver the link with the model, resolution, length, and Gems. Tell the user to watch the whole clip, not one frame: an edit that looks right in a still can break during motion. If the change didn't take or the motion drifted, offer one retry, or Cherry 2 Pro for a final (quote it first).

Prompt editing is not a timeline: it can't make an exact cut or change a specific frame range.

## Errors

| Code | What to do |
|---|---|
| `insufficient_gems` | Give the price and the balance; Gems are added at https://www.mage.space/api?tab=billing. |
| `invalid_config` | The message names the field, value, or `@handle`. Fix it from `get_model` and retry with a new key. |
| `content_blocked` | Mage's policy or the model's filter refused it. Never try to slip past a filter. |
| `too_many_requests` | 20 generations are already running. Wait, then submit again. |
| `generation_failed` | Usually transient and refunded. Retry once with a new key. |
| `requires_media_measurement` | The clip is on a host `estimate_cost` can't measure. Upload it with `create_upload` and price again. |
